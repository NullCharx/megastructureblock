  bootstrap:
    # Let's say that RegistryPlugin registers some data that your plugin needs to use
    # We don't need this during runtime, so it's not required in the server section.
    # However, can be added to both if needed
    #RegistryPlugin:
    #  load: BEFORE
    #  required: true
    #  join-classpath: true # Defaults to true
  server:
    # Add a required "RequiredPlugin" dependency, which will load AFTER your plugin.
    #RequiredPlugin:
    #  load: AFTER
    #  required: true
      # This means that your plugin will not have access to their classpath
    #  join-classpath: false
