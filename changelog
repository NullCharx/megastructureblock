REMEMBER: ALPHA VERSIONS ARE UNSTABLE.
PLEASE REPORT ANY CASE OF THE FOLLOWING IMMEDIATELY VIA THE ISSUE TRACKER:
DANGLING THREADS: Memory optimizing threads might not properly clean, thus residing in memory even after the game is closed
MEMORY LEAK: Please report any RAM over usage: Expected RAM usage for the mod at this point is no more than 5-6GB.
You can force quit any dangling thread on the task manager.
A memory leak can be fixed by restarting your computer.

If you encounter any issue, please post it in the issue tracker

- Added four test blocks under "piltover items" (provisonal creative tab name)
    - Piltite ore block: Natural block spawning north piltover. (Worldgen not implemented yet). When mined it drops:
    - Raw piltite chunk item: Needs of an unimplemented block to create:
    - Refined piltite block: Needs of an unimplemented block to create:
    - Base piltstone block: Northern piltover prominent decoration block.

- Slightly altered world generation block filling to complete asynchronously.
    - World might take up to 15% more time to load on the first teleport /  when spawning into an area with fully undiscovered
    chunks, but it makes up for it being up to +40% faster loading new chunks.

- Added alpha biome assigment system:
    - Reads from a biomemap to set a biome or a group of biomes. If a group of biomes is present, it resorts to vanilla
    bione noise assigment for a natural look.

- Memory optimizations:
    -Map caches will evict the least recently used slice if full (4 images)
    -Changes both the heightmap cache and the biomemap cache so that slices not used within the last five minutes
    will be concurrently removed by a thread.
    -This should help alliveate bloaty memory usage
